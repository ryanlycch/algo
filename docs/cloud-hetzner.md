## API Token

Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and `Generate API Token` with `Read & Write` access. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a project. To interact with the API of another project you have to create a new token inside the project.
